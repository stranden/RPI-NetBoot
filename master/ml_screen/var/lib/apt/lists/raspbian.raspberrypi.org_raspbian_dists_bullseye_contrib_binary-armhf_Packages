Description: toolkit for analysing high-throughput sequencing data
 This package installs the command line tools of the bcbio-nextgen
 toolkit implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high
 throughput sequencing analysis.
 .
 A high-level configuration file specifies inputs and analysis parameters
 to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution,
 idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps.  The project
 contributes a shared community resource that handles the data processing
 component of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time
 to focus on the downstream biology.
 .
 This package builds and having it in Debian unstable helps the Debian
 developers to synchronize their efforts. But unless a series of external
 dependencies are not installed manually, the functionality of bcbio in
 Debian is only a shadow of itself. Please use the official distribution
 of bcbio for the time being, which means "use conda". The TODO file in
 the Debian directory should give an overview on progress for Debian
 packaging.

Description: biological data-bank updater - web interface
 BioMAJ downloads remote data banks, checks their status and applies
 transformation workflows, with consistent state, to provide ready-to-use
 data for biologists and bioinformaticians. For example, it can transform
 original FASTA files into BLAST indexes. It is very flexible and its
 post-processing facilities can be extended very easily.
 .
 BioMAJ watcher provides a management interface for the BioMAJ tool.
 It runs in a web container (Tomcat) and is accessible under the URL
 http://hostname:portnumber/BmajWatcher
 .
 The web interface can give anonymous users an overview of available
 data. Administrators can also use it to manage data-banks, schedule
 updates via cron, view error logs, or use the integrated data-bank
 properties editor.

Description: metapackage for AMD/ATI OpenCL-savvy BOINC client and manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 Regular users (righteously) often find it an unbearable nuisance to
 care for the configuration of BOINC for the OpenCL-savvy AMD/ATI
 graphics cards.  This package adds a series of dependencies from the
 non-free section to the regular boinc package. This also meant this
 binary package to be redistributed in the contrib section of Debian.

 This package installs the HTML version of Guy L. Steele book Common
 Lisp the Language, second edition. This book describes a snapshot of
 the Common Lisp language during the period that the ANSI Common
 Lisp standard was created. Thus, this book describe a NON-STANDARD
 version of Common Lisp which is similar to, but is *NOT*, ANSI
 Common Lisp.
 .
 For reference on ANSI Common Lisp, use the Debian package
 "hyperspec".  This book is included in Debian because, while it does
 differ from the ANSI standard, it has more details than the "hyperspec"
 about the design and usage of Lisp.
 .
 This package does not contain the actual HTML files, but rather
 downloads the HTML archive from the Internet and then installs it.

 arcmin field of view. Spectrally the instrument samples almost the full
 optical domain with a mean resolution of 3000. Spatially, the instrument
 samples the sky with 0.2 arcseconds spatial pixels in the currently offered
 Wide Field Mode with natural seeing (WFM-noAO).

 Diaspora (currently styled diaspora* and formerly styled DIASPORA*) is a free
 personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service.
 Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the
 distributed Diaspora social network.
 .
 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.

Description: MATLAB support for Dynare
 Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic models, in
 particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) and overlapping
 generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare include those relying on
 the rational expectations hypothesis, wherein agents form their expectations
 about the future in a way consistent with the model. But Dynare is also able
 to handle models where expectations are formed differently: on one extreme,
 models where agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme,
 models where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
 state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a learning
 process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare can incorporate
 consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary authorities, investors and
 financial intermediaries. Some degree of heterogeneity can be achieved by
 including several distinct classes of agents in each of the aforementioned
 agent categories.
 .
 Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these models. It
 is able to perform simulations of the model given a calibration of the model
 parameters and is also able to estimate these parameters given a dataset. In
 practice, the user will write a text file containing the list of model
 variables, the dynamic equations linking these variables together, the
 computing tasks to be performed and the desired graphical or numerical
 outputs.
 .
 This package is only useful to users having MATLAB installed on their
 machine. It contains the source of the MEX files and will recompile them using
 the existing MATLAB installation.

 ESI-X was the first stored program scientific interpreter
 for the PDP-8.
 ESI was designed by Dave Waks on 8/3/66 and was vaguely based on
 RAND's JOSS.
 In 1967 Bob Supnik extended the program to support 8KW of memory,
 and this became the "ESI-extended" or ESI-X
 FOCAL was eventually the successor of ESI-X.

 fheroes2: implementation of classic game Heroes of Might and Magic II.
 Heroes of Might and Magic II is a classic fantasy turn-based
 strategy/role-playing game which takes place in the land of Enroth,
 a place of magic.
 There are a multitude of creature types, from griffins to rocs,
 golems to pikemen, unicorns to hydras, and four different dragons.
 Each castle type has six different creatures, from the weak
 to the strong. There are six castle types, each corresponding to
 a hero class: Knight, Sorceress, Wizard (Good side), Barbarian,
 Necromancer and Warlock (Evil side). There are also six different
 types of neutral creatures you can recruit in special structures
 scattered about the maps.
 .
 Original game files from CD are needed to play this game.

Description: GeoLite binary database (downloader)
 GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any IP
 address or hostname originates from. It uses a file-based database.
 .
 This package contains a script that downloads the latest version of the binary
 flavor of the four MaxMind GeoLite databases (Country, IPv6 Country, City, and
 ASN).
 .
 These databases simply contain IP blocks as keys, and countries/cities/ASNs as
 values, which should be more complete and accurate than using reverse DNS
 lookups.
 .
 The MaxMind database itself is made available under a DFSG-compatible license.
 However, it is distributed directly in binary format and the source code for
 generating it is not provided.

Description: Android SDK Documentation from Google
 This package will download the Android SDK Documentation from Google and
 create a Debian package.  This package also aims to strip out all calls to
 the networking, including tracking services like Google Analytics and
 Doubleclick. These documentation files still require the Google "jsapi",
 which is only available by fetching it each time from
 http://www.google.com/jsapi.  This package forces it to use https://, but
 otherwise, these docs have to phone home in order for any of the javascript
 to work.
 .
 WARNING: Installing this Debian package causes docs-24_r01.zip to be
 downloaded from https://dl.google.com and/or from other suggested
 mirrors.  Also, since Google is often blocked in China, the install
 process will try again on Chinese mirrors if the Google central
 download repo is not available.  Since the zipball is checked against
 the embedded SHA1 checksum, the install will fail if the mirror
 contains a corrupted version.

Description: utility to automatically build a Debian package of Google Earth
 Google Earth is a 3D planet viewer that lets you interactively navigate
 satellite imagery, maps, terrain, and so forth.
 .
 Google Earth is available for GNU/Linux from their web site, but is
 non-free software and is undistributable. It also does not integrate
 well into a Debian system.
 .
 This utility makes it possible to build your own personal Debian
 package of Google Earth. The packaging itself is Free Software, but
 the Google Earth program is governed by the copyright holder (Google),
 so you may be limited as to what you can do with the resulting
 package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This package will simply help
 you create the package, it is your responsibility to use the resulting
 package responsibly.

Description: Editor for OpenStreetMap (installer)
 JOSM is an editor for OpenStreetMap (OSM) written in Java.
 The current version supports stand alone GPX tracks, GPX track data
 from OSM database and existing nodes, line segments and metadata tags
 from the OSM database.
 .
 OpenStreetMap is a project aimed squarely at creating and providing
 free geographic data such as street maps to anyone who wants them.
 The project was started because most maps you think of as free actually
 have legal or technical restrictions on their use, holding back people
 from using them in creative, productive or unexpected ways.
 .
 This package provides a script to install the upstream JARs.

Description: Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures (doc)
 The MAGMA project aims to develop a dense linear algebra library similar to
 LAPACK but for heterogeneous/hybrid architectures, starting with current
 "Multicore+GPU" systems.
 .
 The MAGMA research is based on the idea that, to address the complex challenges
 of the emerging hybrid environments, optimal software solutions will themselves
 have to hybridize, combining the strengths of different algorithms within a
 single framework. Building on this idea, we aim to design linear algebra
 algorithms and frameworks for hybrid manycore and GPU systems that can enable
 applications to fully exploit the power that each of the hybrid components
 offers.

Description: Java library for developing numerical applications (documentation)
 MTJ is designed to be used as a library for developing numerical
 applications, both for small and large scale computations. The library
 is based on BLAS and LAPACK for its dense and structured sparse
 computations, and on the Templates project for unstructured sparse
 operations.
 .
 MTJ uses the netlib-java project as a backend, which can be set up to
 use machine-optimised BLAS libraries for improved performance of dense
 matrix operations, falling back to a pure Java implementation. This
 ensures perfect portability, while allowing for improved performance in
 a production environment.

Description: Homebrew package manager for Linux
 Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew, the Mac OS package manager, for Linux.
 .
 It can be installed in your home directory and does not require root
 access. The same package manager can be used on both your Linux server
 and your Mac laptop. Installing a modern version of glibc and gcc in
 your home directory on an old distribution of Linux takes five minutes.
 .
 Features:
  * Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
  * Install software not packaged by the native distribution
  * Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
  * Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines
 .
 This package provides Linuxbrew install scripts instead of linuxbrew itself.

Description: fast NIfTI-1/2 reader and NIfTI-to-JNIfTI converter for MATLAB
 The JNIfTI toolbox includes a stand-alone NIfTI-1/2 parser that works on both
 MATLAB and GNU Octave without needing additional components. To just reading
 and writing the un-compressed NIfTI and Analyze7.5 files (.nii, .hdr/.img),
 one only needs to run addpath('/path/to/jnifti'). For MATLAB, JNIfTI toolbox
 utilizes memmapfile-based disk-reading, making it very fast. For Octave,
 memmapfile is currently not implemented, so, a full reading is required.
 .
 The JNIfTI toolbox is also capable of reading/writing gzip-compressed NIfTI
 and Analyze7.5 files (.nii.gz, .hdr.gz, .img.gz). This feature is supported
 in MATLAB directly without needing another toolbox (MATLAB must be in the
 JVM-enabled mode).
 .
 To process gzip-compressed NIfTI/Analyze files in Octave and MATLAB with
 -nojvm, one need to install the open-source JSONLab and ZMat toolboxes

 JSONLab is a free and open-source implementation of a
 JSON/UBJSON/MessagePack encoder and a decoder in the native MATLAB language.
 It can be used to convert a MATLAB data structure (array, struct, cell,
 struct array and cell array) into JSON/UBJSON formatted string, or decode a
 JSON/UBJSON/MessagePack file into MATLAB data.  JSONLab supports both MATLAB
 and GNU Octave (a free MATLAB clone). JSONLab is now the official reference
 implementation for the JData Specification (Draft 3) - the foundation of the
 OpenJData Project (http://openjdata.org).
 .
 This package provides support for MATLAB.

Description: distro integration for local MATLAB installations
 This package does not provide MATLAB. Instead, it configures an
 existing MATLAB installation to integrate more comfortably in
 a Debian installation.
 .
 Currently it provides /usr/bin/matlab through the alternatives
 system, offers to work around incompatibilities between the libraries
 bundled with MATLAB and system libraries, and provides a helper
 utility meant to be used by other packages to compile MEX extensions.
 .
 Install this if you would like your MATLAB installation to behave more
 like an ordinary Debian package. Other packages may depend on
 this one if they install MATLAB code, for example in order to
 compile MEX extensions.

 The goal is that a game installed via ./play.it is indistinguishable from a
 game installed via the official repositories of your favourite distribution.
 .
 The games are installed globally on multi-user systems, avoiding unnecessary
 duplication. The locations of save games, settings, mods, temporary files and
 backups are standardized with XDG Base Directory support.
 .
 Packaging the games simplifies future updates, uninstalls and handling of any
 necessary dependencies, including integrated obsolete dependencies if specific
 versions are needed.

Description: module to access Nvidia‘s CUDA computation API (documentation)
 PyCUDA lets you access Nvidia‘s CUDA parallel computation API from Python.
 Several wrappers of the CUDA API already exist–so what’s so special about
 PyCUDA?
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and crash-free
    code.  PyCUDA knows about dependencies, too, so (for example) it won’t
    detach from a context before all memory allocated in it is also freed.
  * Convenience. Abstractions like pycuda.driver.SourceModule and
    pycuda.gpuarray.GPUArray make CUDA programming even more convenient than
    with Nvidia’s C-based runtime.
  * Completeness. PyCUDA puts the full power of CUDA’s driver API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All CUDA errors are automatically translated
    into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyCUDA’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful Documentation.

 libzfs_core is intended to be a stable interface for programmatic
 administration of ZFS. This wrapper provides one-to-one wrappers for
 libzfs_core API functions, but the signatures and types are more natural to
 Python.
 .
 nvlists are wrapped as dictionaries or lists depending on their usage.
 Some parameters have default values depending on typical use for
 increased convenience. Enumerations and bit flags become strings and lists
 of strings in Python. Errors are reported as exceptions rather than integer
 errno-style error codes.  The wrapper takes care to provide one-to-many
 mapping of the error codes to the exceptions by interpreting a context
 in which the error code is produced.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.

Description: preparation of in silico drug screening projects
 The field of computational biology is all about modeling
 physiochemical entities. Structural biology is about how
 those entities look in 3D and behave. Assume a specific
 behaviour (and only this) of a drug can be changed in a
 defined way.
 .
 Some good part of the characterisation of promising
 drug-like compounds for their interaction with a larger protein
 can be done on computers. This package helps with getting
 collections of small ligands prepared to be fitted against
 a particular protein of known structure. That docking itself
 is then to be performed by autodock or autodock-vina.
 .
 Raccoon may not find the drug, but it may well find a
 lead to it. To have this package with Debian shall help
 smaller biochemistry labs and grants an opportunity for the
 general public to educate itself and/or actively join in to
 help the world .... just a bit.

Description: repository management tool built on top of git
 Repo is a repository management tool that the Android developers built on top
 of Git. Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
 uploads to the Android revision control system, and automates parts of the
 Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make
 it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an
 executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path. In working
 with the Android source files, you will use Repo for across-network
 operations. For example, with a single Repo command you can download files
 from multiple repositories into your local working directory.
 .
 repo is an unusual tool because it downloads all of its own Python modules
 using GPG-signed git tags, and stores those files as part of the project that
 it is working with.  So this package just provides the wrapper script, which
 provides the GPG signing keys for verifying that the correct Python code was
 downloaded.

Description: Solaris Porting Layer user-space utilities for Linux (dummy)
 The Solaris Porting Layer (SPL) is a Linux kernel module which provides
 many of the Solaris kernel APIs. This shim layer makes it possible to
 run Solaris kernel code in the Linux kernel with relatively minimal
 modification. The Solaris Porting LAyer Tests (SPLAT) is a Linux kernel
 module which provides a testing harness for the SPL module.
 .
 SPL can be particularly useful when you want to track upstream Illumos
 (or any other OpenSolaris fork) development closely and don't want the
 overhead of maintaining a large patch which converts Solaris primitives
 to Linux primitives.

 This is a transitional dummy package. It can safely be removed.

Description: Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line Debian package builder
 This utility makes it possible to build a Debian package from Oracle SQL
 Developer Command-Line (SQLcl). The Oracle SQL Developer program is governed
 by the copyright holder (Oracle USA, Inc.), so you may be limited as to what
 you can do with the resulting package (i.e. no redistribution, etc). This
 utility will simply help you create the Debian package, it is your
 responsibility to use the resulting package accordingly with the OTN license,
 a copy of which is included in the created package, that you must agree on
 when downloading the source.
 .
 This utility will require you to download the architecture independent archive
 from <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sqlcl/overview>,
 identified as "Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line for All Platforms", to create
 the Debian package from.
 .
 Due to a conflicting name with content of package "parallel" the upstream
 binary "sql" will be renamed. Multiple versions can coexist so
 "sql.[upstream version].standalone" will invoke a specific version of
 Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line, "sql.[upstram version]" will invoke
 either the standalone or bundled Oracle SQL Developer Command-Line version
 (in this order), while "sqlcl" (the recommended way) and
 "sqlcl.standalone" take advantage of Debian's alternatives system and,
 when left in auto mode, will always invoke the highest version installed.

Description: Etoys activity for Sugar Learning Platform
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.

Description: ZFS Snapshot Daemon written in python
 Python daemon that manages ZFS snapshots and send/receive backup.
 Based on zfs-snap-manager.
 .
   * Remote ZFS snapshoting/aging wnd replication back to central ZFS
     backup server. Only need to install zfs-utils, zsnapd-rcmd (for secure)
     remote ssh key login and sshd on client, and use root ssh key based
     log in.
   * Has connectivity test to skip scheduled actions when the remote site
     cannot be contacted.  Actually quite useful for ZFS backing up laptops.
     Reachability failures are logged of course!
   * Uses Python3
   * Native systemd support.
   * Configuration is stored in configuration files with the ini file
     format. Configuration .d parts directories also present
   * Triggers the configured actions based on time or a '.trigger' file
     present in the dataset's mountpoint.
   * Can take snapshots (with a yyyymmddhhmm timestamp format).
   * Can replicate snapshots to/from other nodes.
   * Push based when the replication source has access to the replication
     target.
   * Pull based when the replication source has no access to the replication
     target. Typically when you don't want to give all nodes access to the
     backup/replication target.
   * Cleans all snapshots with the yyyymmddhh timestamp schmea format based
     on a GFS schema (Grandfather, Father, Son).  Timestamp
     evaluation based on actual ZFS snapshot creation metadata.
   * Supports pre and post commands.
